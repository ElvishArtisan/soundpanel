This is the README file for the SoundPanel package.

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  See the file COPYING for
details.

This software is BETA code.  As such, it is intended primarily for
testing and evaluation, and may contain bugs, possibly serious ones.

Sound panel is an application for the organization and playout of
audio cuts.  Targeted for use in busy Broadcast and Live Performance 
environments, SoundPanel is capable of referencing hundreds or
thousands of audio cuts, making them available both on programmable 
"panels" of buttons and via SoundPanel's built-in search engine.  The 
intent throughout is to provide *fast* access to a large spectrum of 
audio.  

SoundPanel Features and Benefits:

Optimized for speed.  Any audio in the entire array can be located and
played within a few seconds.

Support for AudioScience HPI sound drivers.

Dynamically-sized panel arrays allow for indexing and access of 
thousands of cuts, limited only by the physical capacity of the 
underlying filesystems.

Built-in audio recorder allows audio to be recorded directly to an array
button, without the need for a separate recording application.

Integrated CD ripper allows CD tracks to be ripped directly to
array buttons (uses the CDParanoia ripper engine).

Built-in hooks to allow seamless use with an external audio editor.

All configuration and setup done using point-and-click interfaces --
*no* arcane configuration files to edit!

Completely free and open -- no dongles, unlock codes, software keys or
other arbitrary limitations.


Installation instructions can be found in the 'INSTALL' file.

Good Luck!
