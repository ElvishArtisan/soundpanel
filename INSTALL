This is the installation file for the SoundPanel package.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building:

X11 Window System
Virtually all Linux distros should include this.

Qt Toolkit, v3.2 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this.  It's typically installed as part
of the KDE Desktop Environment, although KDE itself is by no means required.
It can also be downloaded directly from TrollTech (http://www.trolltech.com/).

AudioScience HPI Driver
For supporting AudioScience's line of high-end professional audio
adapters.  It's available in binary form (with C headers)
from http://www.salemradiolabs.com/asi/.  

The libradio Radio Library
This is a class library that contains much of the 'generic'
functionality used by SoundPanel (and other packages beside).  You can
get it at http://www.salemradiolabs.com/master_download.shtml.  You need 
version 0.94.0 or better.

AudioScience HPI Driver - v2.88 or greater.
For supporting AudioScience's line of high-end professional audio adapters.  
See http://www.audioscience.com/.

LibRHpi library
You'll need version 0.94.4 or greater, available at: 
http://www.salemradiolabs.com/master_download.shtml.

Cdda2Wav - CD Ripper Engine
Optional, but needed if you want the CD ripper to work.  Included in
most distributions, but also available from http://www.cdda2wav.de/.

CDParanoia - Another CD Ripper Engine
Optional, but needed if you want the CD ripper to work.  Needed in
order to support the full 'paranoia' mode of the CD ripper.  Included
in most distributions, but also available from
http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/.

SoX - Sound eXchange Universal Sound Sample Translator
Optional, but needed if you want the CD ripper or sound file importing
to work.  Included in most distributions, but also available from
http://sox.soundforge.net/.

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is most often a matter of 
typing './configure', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install' in
the top level directory. 

QT-4 NOTES
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environmental
variables be set prior to running ./configure in order for Qt 4 to be detected
properly.  Some known case are:

CentOS/RedHat:  export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH

Good Luck!
