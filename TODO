Known bugs and ToDo items for the SoundPanel package:

Documentation!  Any volunteers?

Add dynamic panel quantities, with the ability to insert/delete complete
panels, thus allowing creation of arrays of arbitrary size.  This
should happen as soon as I get all of Qt's STL gunk figured out.
[DONE 4/28/2003 FFG]

Put the ALSA ring buffer service routines in their own thread, rather
than in the primary GUI event loop.

Add GPI support, thus allowing remote control of the buttons from an
audio console or similar control surface.

Anything else?
